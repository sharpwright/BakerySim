# Masteries System

## Summary
A progression system where players organically gain mastery in specific recipes, techniques, or bakery operations through repeated actions, experimentation, and achievement completion, rather than earning generic experience points or levels.

## Problem Statement
Traditional EXP and level-up systems can feel artificial and disconnected from player actions. There is a need for a more immersive and meaningful progression system that rewards players for their unique playstyles, experimentation, and accomplishments within the bakery simulation.

## Benefits
- Progression feels natural and directly tied to player choices and actions.
- Encourages experimentation, specialization, and replayability.
- Integrates seamlessly with achievements and knowledge systems for a cohesive experience.
- Reduces grind and makes each playthrough unique based on mastery paths chosen.

## How It Works
- Players gain mastery in specific recipes, techniques, or bakery areas by performing related actions (e.g., baking croissants increases Croissant Mastery).
- Achievements related to a skill or recipe grant mastery boosts or unlock new mastery tiers.
- Achievement unlocks will activate the mastery path for the recipe.
- Mastery is tracked per recipe, technique, or bakery operation, allowing for deep and personalized progression.
- Mastery milestones unlock unique bonuses, abilities, or recipe variants, encouraging specialization and replayability.

## Examples
- **Recipe Mastery:** Baking a specific pastry multiple times increases its quality, unlocks efficiency bonuses, or reveals secret variants.
- **Technique Mastery:** Frequent use of advanced baking techniques (e.g., lamination, proofing) unlocks new techniques or improves outcomes.
- **Ingredient Mastery:** Using certain ingredients often unlocks sourcing bonuses or special ingredient variants.
- **Bakery Operations Mastery:** Repeatedly optimizing production or managing staff improves efficiency and unlocks automation options.

## Challenges / Risks
- Balancing mastery progression to avoid excessive grind or making it too easy.
- Ensuring the system is transparent and intuitive for players to understand their progress.
- Integrating mastery with achievements and knowledge without overwhelming the player.
