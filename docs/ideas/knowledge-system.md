# Knowledge System

## Summary

Allows a player to gain knowledge and use that to unlock bonuses, abilities, upgrades, etc., through a skill-tree system tied to achievements and in-game actions.

## Problem Statement

Traditional progression systems often rely on generic experience points and leveling up, which can feel disconnected from player actions. This system aims to create a more meaningful progression where players start as home bakers and organically earn knowledge points through achievements and gameplay, helping them build a bakery empire.

## How It Works

- All player actions can unlock achievements.
- Each achievement rewards "Knowledge Points" (KPs).
- Knowledge Points are spent in a skill-tree system to unlock upgrades, abilities, and bonuses.
- More difficult achievements grant more KPs.
- Some unlocks may require additional resources (e.g., money for bakery expansion).
- The skill-tree is divided into three categories: Abilities, Bakery, and Bonuses.
- Players can focus on specific areas, allowing for replayability and unique progression paths.

## Benefits

- Progression is directly tied to player actions and achievements.
- Encourages experimentation and specialization.
- Supports replayability through different skill-tree choices.
- Integrates with other systems (achievements, currency) for deeper gameplay.

## Examples

### Abilities

- **Decorator**: Unlock advanced decoration techniques for pastries, increasing product value.
- **Efficient Baker**: Reduce baking time for all products.
- **Quality Control**: Decrease the chance of failed bakes or burnt products.
- **Customer Insight**: See customer preferences and trends for better product planning.

### Bakery

- **Oven Upgrade**: Increase baking capacity or unlock specialty ovens (e.g., stone oven, convection oven).
- **Stand Mixer**: Produce higher volume recipes or automate dough mixing.
- **Display Case Expansion**: Showcase more products, attracting more customers.
- **Ingredient Storage**: Increase storage space for ingredients, allowing bulk purchases.

### Bonuses

- **Bulk Buyer**: Discounts when purchasing ingredients in large quantities.
- **Premium Pricing**: Ability to charge more for high-quality or decorated products.
- **Marketing Boost**: Attract more customers for a limited time through advertising.

## Challenges / Risks

- Balancing Knowledge Point rewards and unlock costs to avoid grind or trivial progression.
- Ensuring the system is intuitive and transparent for players.
- Integrating with achievements and other progression systems without overwhelming the player.
